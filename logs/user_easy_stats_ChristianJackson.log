2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Number of points scored on different days by a NBA team =  [120, 135, 142, 89, 161, 119, 92, 145, 105, 107, 121, 132, 151]
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The mean of points scored is 124.54
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The median of points scored is 121.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The mode of points scored is 120.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The variance of points scored is 499.44
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The standard deviation of points scored is 22.35
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The smallest number of points scored is 89.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The largest number of points scored is 161.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 The range in the number of points scored is 89.00 - 161.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Correlation requires Python version 3.10 or greater.

2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Here's some time series data about how many points an NBA team could score on a given day:
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 numofgames:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 pts_scored:[120, 135, 142, 89, 161, 119, 92, 145, 105, 107, 121, 132, 151]
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 correlation between numofgames and numofgames = 1.00
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 correlation between numofgames and pts_scored = 0.05
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Here's some bivariant data (2 variables, together):
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 x:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 y:[120, 135, 142, 89, 161, 119, 92, 145, 105, 107, 121, 132, 151]
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689    slope = 0.30
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689    intercept = 122.42
2023-05-18 14:19:47,689 Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.
2023-05-18 14:19:47,695    At future x = 300,
2023-05-18 14:19:47,695    we predict the value of y will be 213.
2023-05-18 14:19:47,695 How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
2023-05-18 14:19:47,695 Remember to close the app. Control c (or d or z maybe) to close it.
